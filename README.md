#Background

Recently hired as a new data engineer at a ficitonal company. For my first major task, I was assigned to do research for the company of the people they employed between the years of 1980 through 1990. All that was given to me was 6 CSV files that remains from that employee database. 

#Analysis

To begin my research, I divide the code into 3 parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

--Data Modeling: Each CSV files was inspected than sketched into an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. I used QuickDBD to help sketch out my schema and pair each table together containing the same information. 

--Data Engineering: After creating my schema diagram, I created tables for each of the six CSV files. Afterwards, I imported the CSV files into their corresponding SQL table. 

--Data Analysis: For my final part, I had to compelte 8 lists. These list contained info about the employee, hire dates in 1986, salary for each employee, manager of each department, and the list of all departments.
